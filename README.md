# ðŸš€ Liftoff Schedule

A simple, real-time rocket launch tracker that displays upcoming rocket launches with live countdown timers. I built this app for fun and to learn about APIs and also because me and my family wanted an easy way to keep track of the next liftoff. I deployed it on Netlify for our own use.

## Features

- Displays upcoming rocket launches in real-time
- Live countdown timers for each launch (updates every second)
- Image and mission details
- Fetches data from The Space Devs Launch Library 2 API

## Tech Stack

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (vanilla)
- [Launch Library 2 API](https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/) by The Space Devs

## How It Works

The app fetches the next 15 upcoming rocket launches from the Launch Library 2 API and displays:
- Mission name
- Launch company
- Rocket name
- Mission description
- Launch date and time
- Live countdown timer
